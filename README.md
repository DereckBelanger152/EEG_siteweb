## About the Project

This repository hosts the official website of the **Club d’Intelligence Artificielle (CIA)** at **Université Laval**.

Our goal is to:

- Present our student-led **AI projects**
- Share club **updates, research, and tools**
- Serve as a **hub** for events, communication, and outreach

The website is now live here: [CIA Official Website](https://cia.ift.ulaval.ca)

It’s a platform for both visibility and collaboration — designed, developed, and maintained by students.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages a mix of modern front-end technologies:

- React.js
- Vue.js
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- Bootstrap

The site is responsive, fast, and continuously evolving — with a focus on clarity, accessibility, and performance.
