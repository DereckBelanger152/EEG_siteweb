The simple will to make the little character avoid obstacles is enough to make it move. We are very proud of the work we have accomplished; it may only be the beginning of a video game revolution! Think about it, what if we combined this mechanic to a VR headset? Or, what if this is the skipping stone to helping people with disabilities by giving them power from their own thoughts?
