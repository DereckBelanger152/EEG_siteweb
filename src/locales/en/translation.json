      "paragraph1": "Artificial intelligence isn't just about neural networks or traditional algorithms. Some systems, based on simple rules, can generate astonishingly complex behaviors. This is the case with Lenia, an advanced cellular automaton inspired by the famous Game of Life by John Conway.",
      "paragraph2": "Unlike the Game of Life, where cells are either alive or dead and evolve in discrete steps, Lenia operates with continuous values and fluid time. This allows for the emergence of dynamic, self-organizing structures that behave in ways reminiscent of living organisms. Each pixel (or \"cell\") in Lenia has a numerical value, which can be thought of as the concentration of a chemical species. These cells interact with their surroundings using convolution filters, which determine how a cell \"perceives\" its neighbors. A convolution filter is essentially a weighted sum of nearby cell values, meaning that instead of just checking immediate neighbors, Lenia applies a structured pattern—often in the shape of a ring—to determine how different distances contribute to a cell's evolution. The result is then passed through a growth function, which decides whether a cell's value increases or decreases based on the surrounding environment. When applied across the entire grid, this process generates complex, lifelike behaviors from simple mathematical rules.",
      "paragraph3": "Our team successfully implemented a single-channel version of Lenia, where only one \"chemical species\" exists. However, we faced challenges in extending it to three channels, where multiple interacting species (represented as RGB values in visualization) would dramatically expand the possibilities for emergent behaviors. Unlike the Game of Life, which has a well-documented \"bestiary\" of interesting starting configurations, Lenia lacks a standardized library of known patterns, making it harder to find stable and fascinating structures.",
      "paragraph4": "This project offers an exciting opportunity to explore emergence in artificial intelligence, where complex behaviors arise from simple interactions. We invite students, researchers, and AI enthusiasts to join us in pushing the boundaries of self-organizing systems and discovering the hidden potential of Lenia."

The project focuses on two main goals: first, intelligently reducing datasets by keeping only the most relevant examples; and second, studying how many examples are truly necessary to reconstruct a trained decision tree.",
      "description2": "Students involved in the project are encouraged to design, implement, and test algorithms in Python, experiment with real datasets, compare different training strategies, and interpret the outcomes critically. The project emphasizes scientific rigor and creative problem-solving, offering a great opportunity to experience what it’s like to run a real AI research project — from literature review and ideation to coding and experimental validation.",
      "description3": "If you're curious, enjoy digging into how machine learning models actually work, and want to contribute to a meaningful and engaging team project, TreeCore is for you. No matter your current level, if you're motivated and eager to learn, there's a place for you — whether in coding, analysis, or even communication and outreach. The project will continue in the fall, and we’re actively looking for new members to join us!",
